This is a quick reference for developers and testers.
The driver codes are tested aganist kernel version above 3.14.0. 

1. Build kernel module and user space tool:

   (1) $ make

2. Load the driver into running kernel:

   (1) $ sudo make install
   (2) (if kernel requires signed modules) $ sudo depmod --quick
   (3) $ sudo modprobe dm-imrsim

3. Verify module was loaded successfully and appears as an available device mapper target:

   (4) $ dmsetup targets

4. Prepare a block drive:

   Note: The maximum IMRSim size is 2MB larger than the available capacity in order
         to write some persistence data.

   (a) Use either a block device (e.g. /dev/sdb) or partition (e.g. /dev/sdb1) with capacity > 256MB.

   (b) or, use a loop device with four 256 MB zones:

      1. $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/imrsim1 bs=4096 seek=$(((256*4+64)*1024*1024/4096-1)) count=1
      2. $ losetup /dev/loop1 /tmp/imrsim1
      3. (when no longer needed) $ losetup -d /dev/loop1


   (c) or, use a loop device with 400 256 MB zones:  （100G）

      1. $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/imrsim1 bs=4096 seek=$(((256*400+128)*1024*1024/4096-1)) count=1
      2. $ losetup /dev/loop1 /tmp/imrsim1
      3. (when no longer needed) $ losetup -d /dev/loop1

      80 zones; 41943030 sectors

5. Determine the 256 MB zone capacity and number of 512-byte sectors required for those zones:

   (a) zones:

      1. $ imrsim_util/imr_format.sh -z -d /dev/loop1

   (b) sectors:

      1. $ imrsim_util/imr_format.sh -d /dev/loop1

   (c) to use less than the total zone capacity

         X = (524288 * n)
         524288 <= X <= Max_sec

         n = 1, 2, 3, ... , MAX_sec / 524288

6. Create IRMSim device

   1. $ echo "0 `imrsim_util/imr_format.sh -d /dev/loop1` imrsim /dev/loop1 0" | dmsetup create imrsim
   2. (when no longer needed) $ sudo dmsetup remove imrsim

    If successful, the IMRsim device created with device name:

    /dev/mapper/imrsim  - this is a ZAC/ZBC block volume

    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | CMR - 256 MB | Zone 1 - 256 MB |  ...  | Zone n - 256 MB | CMR - 256 MB |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    After above steps, the driver module will create a default zone configuration with
    256MB zone size, the first and last zones are the conventional zones, and others
    are sequential zones. The zone configuration can be changed in different zone type
    and zone size. But the type of the zone is restricted to follow the current ZAC/ZBC 
    specs. Run imrsim_util commands to do limitted configuration changes.

    Notes:
 
    If the driver module wasn't successfully loaded, there is a case that metadata 
    persisted contents don't match to current device. Use Linux commands to erase the
    first sector or all persistence space in the reserved area.

    If the IMRSim size (X above) is changed it will be persisted. But if recreate the device
    with different size, previous persisted metadata will be no longer matching to current 
    device although the data was persisted valid. Using reset to default config command to 
    flush new metadata to the persistence repository.
    
    The driver module doesn't support multiple IMRSim devices yet. Any attempt to create 
    more than one IMRSim device will be rejected. 

7. Run test/util commands in imrsim-util or run dd command

   Notes: The address and data size have to be 4KB aligned.

8. Test on Filesystems

   Testing and research notes:
   
   imrsim device is a block device with IMR rules guarded. To learn full pictures on which rule 
   violation may happen after mounting a filesystem to the device, one option is to turn on the
   read and write out of policy flags by using the utility tool. All violation statistics and 
   zone status can be viewed after read/write or other operations.
